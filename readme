# Stepper Motor Control with LCD and Encoder

This Arduino sketch demonstrates controlling two stepper motors using the HiLetgo 3D Printer Reprap Smart Controller 12864 LCD Display, an encoder, and a button. The stepper motors are connected through the RAMPS 1.4 Arduino Mega shield.

## Hardware Requirements
- Arduino Mega board
- RAMPS 1.4 shield
- HiLetgo 3D Printer Reprap Smart Controller 12864 LCD Display
- Two stepper motors
- Two end stop switches
- Buzzer
- Encoder

## Circuit Diagram
Insert a circuit diagram here to illustrate the connections between the components.

## Installation and Usage
1. Connect the components according to the circuit diagram.
2. Open the Arduino IDE.
3. Install the U8glib and AccelStepper libraries if not already installed.
4. Open the `stepper_control.ino` sketch.
5. Select the appropriate board and port from the Arduino IDE.
6. Upload the sketch to the Arduino board.
7. Monitor the LCD display for the motor control and distance readings.

## Functionality
- The LCD display shows "Hello, World!" on the screen.
- Adjust the speed of stepper1 using the encoder.
- Press the button to activate the buzzer.
- The distance encoder measures wire distance and displays the value on the LCD screen.
- Two end stop switches change the direction of the corresponding stepper motor when activated.

## Customization
- Adjust the pin connections according to your wiring setup.
- Modify the `MAX_SPEED` and `ACCELERATION` constants to change the speed and acceleration of the stepper motors.
- Customize the LCD messages and formatting as needed.
- Adapt the code to your specific requirements and additional functionality.

Apologies for the confusion in my previous responses. The correct library for the U8g2 display is the U8g2 library, not the U8glib library. You can download the U8g2 library from the following link:

[U8g2 library](https://github.com/olikraus/U8g2_Arduino)

Once you have downloaded the library, you can install it in the Arduino IDE by following these steps:

1. Open the Arduino IDE.
2. Go to "Sketch" -> "Include Library" -> "Add .ZIP Library".
3. Browse to the location where you downloaded the U8g2 library .zip file and select it.
4. Click the "Open" button.
5. The library will be installed, and you can now use the U8g2 library in your Arduino sketches.

Please note that the U8g2 library provides extensive documentation and examples to help you understand and use the library effectively. You can refer to the library's documentation and examples to explore the various features and capabilities of the U8g2 library with your specific display.
